# Computational-Intelligence-project-Fall-2025
During this project, you will develop a foundational neural network library from scratch using only Python and NumPy, validating it on the classic XOR problem. Second, you will use your library to build and train an unsupervised encoder-decoder (autoencoder) network for image reconstruction. Finally, you will use the trained encoder as a feature extractor, feeding its latent space representations into an SVM to perform supervised classification.
